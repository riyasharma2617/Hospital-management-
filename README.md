# Hospital-management-
 I have undertaken the project of HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT for hospital; proposed project is present in C in duration of one year.
 The main aim of developing hospital management is to eliminate errors in the present manual system. 
Simple Hospital Management System is based on the concept of managing a patient's record of a hospital.
There's no login system available for this system, the user can freely use its feature. 
This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one. To run this project you can use Dev C++ or Code Blocks IDE. 
About the project Talking about the features of this Simple system, the user can perform the CRUD operations to it.
Like, add patient details by entering his/her name, disease name, phone number, cabin number, etc. 
The user can also view all the available patient records. Such as details and search a patient by its name, age, disease, cabin number. 
Besides, the user can edit information as well as remove a patient's whole date or only his/her name, phone number, disease name, cabin number. 
The system creates an external file to store the user's data permanently. 
This system is developed using C Programming Language and different variables, strings have been used for the development of it. 
Simple Hospital Management System in C Programming with source code is free to download. Use for educational purposes only
